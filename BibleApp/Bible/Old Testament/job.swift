1In the land of Uz there lived a man whose name was Job. This man was blameless and upright; he feared God and shunned evil.
2He had seven sons and three daughters,
3and he owned seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen and five hundred donkeys, and had a large number of servants. He was the greatest man among all the people of the East.
4His sons used to take turns holding feasts in their homes, and they would invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them.
5When a period of feasting had run its course, Job would send and have them purified. Early in the morning he would sacrifice a burnt offering for each of them, thinking, "Perhaps my children have sinned and cursed God in their hearts." This was Job's regular custom.
6One day the angels came to present themselves before the Lord , and Satan also came with them.
7The Lord said to Satan, "Where have you come from?" Satan answered the Lord , "From roaming through the earth and going back and forth in it."
8Then the Lord said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil."
9"Does Job fear God for nothing?" Satan replied.
10"Have you not put a hedge around him and his household and everything he has? You have blessed the work of his hands, so that his flocks and herds are spread throughout the land.
11But stretch out your hand and strike everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your face."
12The Lord said to Satan, "Very well, then, everything he has is in your hands, but on the man himself do not lay a finger." Then Satan went out from the presence of the Lord .
13One day when Job's sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the oldest brother's house,
14a messenger came to Job and said, "The oxen were plowing and the donkeys were grazing nearby,
15and the Sabeans attacked and carried them off. They put the servants to the sword, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!"
16While he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, "The fire of God fell from the sky and burned up the sheep and the servants, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!"
17While he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, "The Chaldeans formed three raiding parties and swept down on your camels and carried them off. They put the servants to the sword, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!"
18While he was still speaking, yet another messenger came and said, "Your sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the oldest brother's house,
19when suddenly a mighty wind swept in from the desert and struck the four corners of the house. It collapsed on them and they are dead, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!"
20At this, Job got up and tore his robe and shaved his head. Then he fell to the ground in worship
21and said: "Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked I will depart. The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away; may the name of the Lord be praised."
22In all this, Job did not sin by charging God with wrongdoing.
2On another day the angels came to present themselves before the Lord , and Satan also came with them to present himself before him.
2And the Lord said to Satan, "Where have you come from?" Satan answered the Lord , "From roaming through the earth and going back and forth in it."
3Then the Lord said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil. And he still maintains his integrity, though you incited me against him to ruin him without any reason."
4"Skin for skin!" Satan replied. "A man will give all he has for his own life.
5But stretch out your hand and strike his flesh and bones, and he will surely curse you to your face."
6The Lord said to Satan, "Very well, then, he is in your hands; but you must spare his life."
7So Satan went out from the presence of the Lord and afflicted Job with painful sores from the soles of his feet to the top of his head.
8Then Job took a piece of broken pottery and scraped himself with it as he sat among the ashes.
9His wife said to him, "Are you still holding on to your integrity? Curse God and die!"
10He replied, "You are talking like a foolish woman. Shall we accept good from God, and not trouble?" In all this, Job did not sin in what he said.
11When Job's three friends, Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite, heard about all the troubles that had come upon him, they set out from their homes and met together by agreement to go and sympathize with him and comfort him.
12When they saw him from a distance, they could hardly recognize him; they began to weep aloud, and they tore their robes and sprinkled dust on their heads.
13Then they sat on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights. No one said a word to him, because they saw how great his suffering was.
3After this, Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth.
2He said:
3"May the day of my birth perish, and the night it was said, 'A boy is born!'
4That day-may it turn to darkness; may God above not care about it; may no light shine upon it.
5May darkness and deep shadow claim it once more; may a cloud settle over it; may blackness overwhelm its light.
6That night-may thick darkness seize it; may it not be included among the days of the year nor be entered in any of the months.
7May that night be barren; may no shout of joy be heard in it.
8May those who curse days curse that day, those who are ready to rouse Leviathan.
9May its morning stars become dark; may it wait for daylight in vain and not see the first rays of dawn,
10for it did not shut the doors of the womb on me to hide trouble from my eyes.
11"Why did I not perish at birth, and die as I came from the womb?
12Why were there knees to receive me and breasts that I might be nursed?
13For now I would be lying down in peace; I would be asleep and at rest
14with kings and counselors of the earth, who built for themselves places now lying in ruins,
15with rulers who had gold, who filled their houses with silver.
16Or why was I not hidden in the ground like a stillborn child, like an infant who never saw the light of day?
17There the wicked cease from turmoil, and there the weary are at rest.
18Captives also enjoy their ease; they no longer hear the slave driver's shout.
19The small and the great are there, and the slave is freed from his master.
20"Why is light given to those in misery, and life to the bitter of soul,
21to those who long for death that does not come, who search for it more than for hidden treasure,
22who are filled with gladness and rejoice when they reach the grave?
23Why is life given to a man whose way is hidden, whom God has hedged in?
24For sighing comes to me instead of food; my groans pour out like water.
25What I feared has come upon me; what I dreaded has happened to me.
26I have no peace, no quietness; I have no rest, but only turmoil."
4Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:
2"If someone ventures a word with you, will you be impatient? But who can keep from speaking?
3Think how you have instructed many, how you have strengthened feeble hands.
4Your words have supported those who stumbled; you have strengthened faltering knees.
5But now trouble comes to you, and you are discouraged; it strikes you, and you are dismayed.
6Should not your piety be your confidence and your blameless ways your hope?
7"Consider now: Who, being innocent, has ever perished? Where were the upright ever destroyed?
8As I have observed, those who plow evil and those who sow trouble reap it.
9At the breath of God they are destroyed; at the blast of his anger they perish.
10The lions may roar and growl, yet the teeth of the great lions are broken.
11The lion perishes for lack of prey, and the cubs of the lioness are scattered.
12"A word was secretly brought to me, my ears caught a whisper of it.
13Amid disquieting dreams in the night, when deep sleep falls on men,
14fear and trembling seized me and made all my bones shake.
15A spirit glided past my face, and the hair on my body stood on end.
16It stopped, but I could not tell what it was. A form stood before my eyes, and I heard a hushed voice:
17'Can a mortal be more righteous than God? Can a man be more pure than his Maker?
18If God places no trust in his servants, if he charges his angels with error,
19how much more those who live in houses of clay, whose foundations are in the dust, who are crushed more readily than a moth!
20Between dawn and dusk they are broken to pieces; unnoticed, they perish forever.
21Are not the cords of their tent pulled up, so that they die without wisdom?'
5"Call if you will, but who will answer you? To which of the holy ones will you turn?
2Resentment kills a fool, and envy slays the simple.
3I myself have seen a fool taking root, but suddenly his house was cursed.
4His children are far from safety, crushed in court without a defender.
5The hungry consume his harvest, taking it even from among thorns, and the thirsty pant after his wealth.
6For hardship does not spring from the soil, nor does trouble sprout from the ground.
7Yet man is born to trouble as surely as sparks fly upward.
8"But if it were I, I would appeal to God; I would lay my cause before him.
9He performs wonders that cannot be fathomed, miracles that cannot be counted.
10He bestows rain on the earth; he sends water upon the countryside.
11The lowly he sets on high, and those who mourn are lifted to safety.
12He thwarts the plans of the crafty, so that their hands achieve no success.
13He catches the wise in their craftiness, and the schemes of the wily are swept away.
14Darkness comes upon them in the daytime; at noon they grope as in the night.
15He saves the needy from the sword in their mouth; he saves them from the clutches of the powerful.
16So the poor have hope, and injustice shuts its mouth.
17"Blessed is the man whom God corrects; so do not despise the discipline of the Almighty.
18For he wounds, but he also binds up; he injures, but his hands also heal.
19From six calamities he will rescue you; in seven no harm will befall you.
20In famine he will ransom you from death, and in battle from the stroke of the sword.
21You will be protected from the lash of the tongue, and need not fear when destruction comes.
22You will laugh at destruction and famine, and need not fear the beasts of the earth.
23For you will have a covenant with the stones of the field, and the wild animals will be at peace with you.
24You will know that your tent is secure; you will take stock of your property and find nothing missing.
25You will know that your children will be many, and your descendants like the grass of the earth.
26You will come to the grave in full vigor, like sheaves gathered in season.
27"We have examined this, and it is true. So hear it and apply it to yourself."
6Then Job replied:
2"If only my anguish could be weighed and all my misery be placed on the scales!
3It would surely outweigh the sand of the seas- no wonder my words have been impetuous.
4The arrows of the Almighty are in me, my spirit drinks in their poison; God's terrors are marshaled against me.
5Does a wild donkey bray when it has grass, or an ox bellow when it has fodder?
6Is tasteless food eaten without salt, or is there flavor in the white of an egg ?
7I refuse to touch it; such food makes me ill.
8"Oh, that I might have my request, that God would grant what I hope for,
9that God would be willing to crush me, to let loose his hand and cut me off!
10Then I would still have this consolation- my joy in unrelenting pain- that I had not denied the words of the Holy One.
11"What strength do I have, that I should still hope? What prospects, that I should be patient?
12Do I have the strength of stone? Is my flesh bronze?
13Do I have any power to help myself, now that success has been driven from me?
14"A despairing man should have the devotion of his friends, even though he forsakes the fear of the Almighty.
15But my brothers are as undependable as intermittent streams, as the streams that overflow
16when darkened by thawing ice and swollen with melting snow,
17but that cease to flow in the dry season, and in the heat vanish from their channels.
18Caravans turn aside from their routes; they go up into the wasteland and perish.
19The caravans of Tema look for water, the traveling merchants of Sheba look in hope.
20They are distressed, because they had been confident; they arrive there, only to be disappointed.
21Now you too have proved to be of no help; you see something dreadful and are afraid.
22Have I ever said, 'Give something on my behalf, pay a ransom for me from your wealth,
23deliver me from the hand of the enemy, ransom me from the clutches of the ruthless'?
24"Teach me, and I will be quiet; show me where I have been wrong.
25How painful are honest words! But what do your arguments prove?
26Do you mean to correct what I say, and treat the words of a despairing man as wind?
27You would even cast lots for the fatherless and barter away your friend.
28"But now be so kind as to look at me. Would I lie to your face?
29Relent, do not be unjust; reconsider, for my integrity is at stake.
30Is there any wickedness on my lips? Can my mouth not discern malice?
7"Does not man have hard service on earth? Are not his days like those of a hired man?
2Like a slave longing for the evening shadows, or a hired man waiting eagerly for his wages,
3so I have been allotted months of futility, and nights of misery have been assigned to me.
4When I lie down I think, 'How long before I get up?' The night drags on, and I toss till dawn.
5My body is clothed with worms and scabs, my skin is broken and festering.
6"My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and they come to an end without hope.
7Remember, O God, that my life is but a breath; my eyes will never see happiness again.
8The eye that now sees me will see me no longer; you will look for me, but I will be no more.
9As a cloud vanishes and is gone, so he who goes down to the grave does not return.
10He will never come to his house again; his place will know him no more.
11"Therefore I will not keep silent; I will speak out in the anguish of my spirit, I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
12Am I the sea, or the monster of the deep, that you put me under guard?
13When I think my bed will comfort me and my couch will ease my complaint,
14even then you frighten me with dreams and terrify me with visions,
15so that I prefer strangling and death, rather than this body of mine.
16I despise my life; I would not live forever. Let me alone; my days have no meaning.
17"What is man that you make so much of him, that you give him so much attention,
18that you examine him every morning and test him every moment?
19Will you never look away from me, or let me alone even for an instant?
20If I have sinned, what have I done to you, O watcher of men? Why have you made me your target? Have I become a burden to you?
21Why do you not pardon my offenses and forgive my sins? For I will soon lie down in the dust; you will search for me, but I will be no more."
8Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:
2"How long will you say such things? Your words are a blustering wind.
3Does God pervert justice? Does the Almighty pervert what is right?
4When your children sinned against him, he gave them over to the penalty of their sin.
5But if you will look to God and plead with the Almighty,
6if you are pure and upright, even now he will rouse himself on your behalf and restore you to your rightful place.
7Your beginnings will seem humble, so prosperous will your future be.
8"Ask the former generations and find out what their fathers learned,
9for we were born only yesterday and know nothing, and our days on earth are but a shadow.
10Will they not instruct you and tell you? Will they not bring forth words from their understanding?
11Can papyrus grow tall where there is no marsh? Can reeds thrive without water?
12While still growing and uncut, they wither more quickly than grass.
13Such is the destiny of all who forget God; so perishes the hope of the godless.
14What he trusts in is fragile ; what he relies on is a spider's web.
15He leans on his web, but it gives way; he clings to it, but it does not hold.
16He is like a well-watered plant in the sunshine, spreading its shoots over the garden;
17it entwines its roots around a pile of rocks and looks for a place among the stones.
18But when it is torn from its spot, that place disowns it and says, 'I never saw you.'
19Surely its life withers away, and from the soil other plants grow.
20"Surely God does not reject a blameless man or strengthen the hands of evildoers.
21He will yet fill your mouth with laughter and your lips with shouts of joy.
22Your enemies will be clothed in shame, and the tents of the wicked will be no more."
9Then Job replied:
2"Indeed, I know that this is true. But how can a mortal be righteous before God?
3Though one wished to dispute with him, he could not answer him one time out of a thousand.
4His wisdom is profound, his power is vast. Who has resisted him and come out unscathed?
5He moves mountains without their knowing it and overturns them in his anger.
6He shakes the earth from its place and makes its pillars tremble.
7He speaks to the sun and it does not shine; he seals off the light of the stars.
8He alone stretches out the heavens and treads on the waves of the sea.
9He is the Maker of the Bear and Orion, the Pleiades and the constellations of the south.
10He performs wonders that cannot be fathomed, miracles that cannot be counted.
11When he passes me, I cannot see him; when he goes by, I cannot perceive him.
12If he snatches away, who can stop him? Who can say to him, 'What are you doing?'
13God does not restrain his anger; even the cohorts of Rahab cowered at his feet.
14"How then can I dispute with him? How can I find words to argue with him?
15Though I were innocent, I could not answer him; I could only plead with my Judge for mercy.
16Even if I summoned him and he responded, I do not believe he would give me a hearing.
17He would crush me with a storm and multiply my wounds for no reason.
18He would not let me regain my breath but would overwhelm me with misery.
19If it is a matter of strength, he is mighty! And if it is a matter of justice, who will summon him ?
20Even if I were innocent, my mouth would condemn me; if I were blameless, it would pronounce me guilty.
21"Although I am blameless, I have no concern for myself; I despise my own life.
22It is all the same; that is why I say, 'He destroys both the blameless and the wicked.'
23When a scourge brings sudden death, he mocks the despair of the innocent.
24When a land falls into the hands of the wicked, he blindfolds its judges. If it is not he, then who is it?
25"My days are swifter than a runner; they fly away without a glimpse of joy.
26They skim past like boats of papyrus, like eagles swooping down on their prey.
27If I say, 'I will forget my complaint, I will change my expression, and smile,'
28I still dread all my sufferings, for I know you will not hold me innocent.
29Since I am already found guilty, why should I struggle in vain?
30Even if I washed myself with soap and my hands with washing soda,
31you would plunge me into a slime pit so that even my clothes would detest me.
32"He is not a man like me that I might answer him, that we might confront each other in court.
33If only there were someone to arbitrate between us, to lay his hand upon us both,
34someone to remove God's rod from me, so that his terror would frighten me no more.
35Then I would speak up without fear of him, but as it now stands with me, I cannot.
10"I loathe my very life; therefore I will give free rein to my complaint and speak out in the bitterness of my soul.
2I will say to God: Do not condemn me, but tell me what charges you have against me.
3Does it please you to oppress me, to spurn the work of your hands, while you smile on the schemes of the wicked?
4Do you have eyes of flesh? Do you see as a mortal sees?
5Are your days like those of a mortal or your years like those of a man,
6that you must search out my faults and probe after my sin-
7though you know that I am not guilty and that no one can rescue me from your hand?
8"Your hands shaped me and made me. Will you now turn and destroy me?
9Remember that you molded me like clay. Will you now turn me to dust again?
10Did you not pour me out like milk and curdle me like cheese,
11clothe me with skin and flesh and knit me together with bones and sinews?
12You gave me life and showed me kindness, and in your providence watched over my spirit.
13"But this is what you concealed in your heart, and I know that this was in your mind:
14If I sinned, you would be watching me and would not let my offense go unpunished.
15If I am guilty-woe to me! Even if I am innocent, I cannot lift my head, for I am full of shame and drowned in my affliction.
16If I hold my head high, you stalk me like a lion and again display your awesome power against me.
17You bring new witnesses against me and increase your anger toward me; your forces come against me wave upon wave.
18"Why then did you bring me out of the womb? I wish I had died before any eye saw me.
19If only I had never come into being, or had been carried straight from the womb to the grave!
20Are not my few days almost over? Turn away from me so I can have a moment's joy
21before I go to the place of no return, to the land of gloom and deep shadow,
22to the land of deepest night, of deep shadow and disorder, where even the light is like darkness."
11Then Zophar the Naamathite replied:
2"Are all these words to go unanswered? Is this talker to be vindicated?
3Will your idle talk reduce men to silence? Will no one rebuke you when you mock?
4You say to God, 'My beliefs are flawless and I am pure in your sight.'
5Oh, how I wish that God would speak, that he would open his lips against you
6and disclose to you the secrets of wisdom, for true wisdom has two sides. Know this: God has even forgotten some of your sin.
7"Can you fathom the mysteries of God? Can you probe the limits of the Almighty?
8They are higher than the heavens-what can you do? They are deeper than the depths of the grave -what can you know?
9Their measure is longer than the earth and wider than the sea.
10"If he comes along and confines you in prison and convenes a court, who can oppose him?
11Surely he recognizes deceitful men; and when he sees evil, does he not take note?
12But a witless man can no more become wise than a wild donkey's colt can be born a man.
13"Yet if you devote your heart to him and stretch out your hands to him,
14if you put away the sin that is in your hand and allow no evil to dwell in your tent,
15then you will lift up your face without shame; you will stand firm and without fear.
16You will surely forget your trouble, recalling it only as waters gone by.
17Life will be brighter than noonday, and darkness will become like morning.
18You will be secure, because there is hope; you will look about you and take your rest in safety.
19You will lie down, with no one to make you afraid, and many will court your favor.
20But the eyes of the wicked will fail, and escape will elude them; their hope will become a dying gasp."
12Then Job replied:
2"Doubtless you are the people, and wisdom will die with you!
3But I have a mind as well as you; I am not inferior to you. Who does not know all these things?
4"I have become a laughingstock to my friends, though I called upon God and he answered- a mere laughingstock, though righteous and blameless!
5Men at ease have contempt for misfortune as the fate of those whose feet are slipping.
6The tents of marauders are undisturbed, and those who provoke God are secure- those who carry their god in their hands.
7"But ask the animals, and they will teach you, or the birds of the air, and they will tell you;
8or speak to the earth, and it will teach you, or let the fish of the sea inform you.
9Which of all these does not know that the hand of the Lord has done this?
10In his hand is the life of every creature and the breath of all mankind.
11Does not the ear test words as the tongue tastes food?
12Is not wisdom found among the aged? Does not long life bring understanding?
13"To God belong wisdom and power; counsel and understanding are his.
14What he tears down cannot be rebuilt; the man he imprisons cannot be released.
15If he holds back the waters, there is drought; if he lets them loose, they devastate the land.
16To him belong strength and victory; both deceived and deceiver are his.
17He leads counselors away stripped and makes fools of judges.
18He takes off the shackles put on by kings and ties a loincloth around their waist.
19He leads priests away stripped and overthrows men long established.
20He silences the lips of trusted advisers and takes away the discernment of elders.
21He pours contempt on nobles and disarms the mighty.
22He reveals the deep things of darkness and brings deep shadows into the light.
23He makes nations great, and destroys them; he enlarges nations, and disperses them.
24He deprives the leaders of the earth of their reason; he sends them wandering through a trackless waste.
25They grope in darkness with no light; he makes them stagger like drunkards.
13"My eyes have seen all this, my ears have heard and understood it.
2What you know, I also know; I am not inferior to you.
3But I desire to speak to the Almighty and to argue my case with God.
4You, however, smear me with lies; you are worthless physicians, all of you!
5If only you would be altogether silent! For you, that would be wisdom.
6Hear now my argument; listen to the plea of my lips.
7Will you speak wickedly on God's behalf? Will you speak deceitfully for him?
8Will you show him partiality? Will you argue the case for God?
9Would it turn out well if he examined you? Could you deceive him as you might deceive men?
10He would surely rebuke you if you secretly showed partiality.
11Would not his splendor terrify you? Would not the dread of him fall on you?
12Your maxims are proverbs of ashes; your defenses are defenses of clay.
13"Keep silent and let me speak; then let come to me what may.
14Why do I put myself in jeopardy and take my life in my hands?
15Though he slay me, yet will I hope in him; I will surely defend my ways to his face.
16Indeed, this will turn out for my deliverance, for no godless man would dare come before him!
17Listen carefully to my words; let your ears take in what I say.
18Now that I have prepared my case, I know I will be vindicated.
19Can anyone bring charges against me? If so, I will be silent and die.
20"Only grant me these two things, O God, and then I will not hide from you:
21Withdraw your hand far from me, and stop frightening me with your terrors.
22Then summon me and I will answer, or let me speak, and you reply.
23How many wrongs and sins have I committed? Show me my offense and my sin.
24Why do you hide your face and consider me your enemy?
25Will you torment a windblown leaf? Will you chase after dry chaff?
26For you write down bitter things against me and make me inherit the sins of my youth.
27You fasten my feet in shackles; you keep close watch on all my paths by putting marks on the soles of my feet.
28"So man wastes away like something rotten, like a garment eaten by moths.
14"Man born of woman is of few days and full of trouble.
2He springs up like a flower and withers away; like a fleeting shadow, he does not endure.
3Do you fix your eye on such a one? Will you bring him before you for judgment?
4Who can bring what is pure from the impure? No one!
5Man's days are determined; you have decreed the number of his months and have set limits he cannot exceed.
6So look away from him and let him alone, till he has put in his time like a hired man.
7"At least there is hope for a tree: If it is cut down, it will sprout again, and its new shoots will not fail.
8Its roots may grow old in the ground and its stump die in the soil,
9yet at the scent of water it will bud and put forth shoots like a plant.
10But man dies and is laid low; he breathes his last and is no more.
11As water disappears from the sea or a riverbed becomes parched and dry,
12so man lies down and does not rise; till the heavens are no more, men will not awake or be roused from their sleep.
13"If only you would hide me in the grave and conceal me till your anger has passed! If only you would set me a time and then remember me!
14If a man dies, will he live again? All the days of my hard service I will wait for my renewal to come.
15You will call and I will answer you; you will long for the creature your hands have made.
16Surely then you will count my steps but not keep track of my sin.
17My offenses will be sealed up in a bag; you will cover over my sin.
18"But as a mountain erodes and crumbles and as a rock is moved from its place,
19as water wears away stones and torrents wash away the soil, so you destroy man's hope.
20You overpower him once for all, and he is gone; you change his countenance and send him away.
21If his sons are honored, he does not know it; if they are brought low, he does not see it.
22He feels but the pain of his own body and mourns only for himself."
15Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:
2"Would a wise man answer with empty notions or fill his belly with the hot east wind?
3Would he argue with useless words, with speeches that have no value?
4But you even undermine piety and hinder devotion to God.
5Your sin prompts your mouth; you adopt the tongue of the crafty.
6Your own mouth condemns you, not mine; your own lips testify against you.
7"Are you the first man ever born? Were you brought forth before the hills?
8Do you listen in on God's council? Do you limit wisdom to yourself?
9What do you know that we do not know? What insights do you have that we do not have?
10The gray-haired and the aged are on our side, men even older than your father.
11Are God's consolations not enough for you, words spoken gently to you?
12Why has your heart carried you away, and why do your eyes flash,
13so that you vent your rage against God and pour out such words from your mouth?
14"What is man, that he could be pure, or one born of woman, that he could be righteous?
15If God places no trust in his holy ones, if even the heavens are not pure in his eyes,
16how much less man, who is vile and corrupt, who drinks up evil like water!
17"Listen to me and I will explain to you; let me tell you what I have seen,
18what wise men have declared, hiding nothing received from their fathers
19(to whom alone the land was given when no alien passed among them):
20All his days the wicked man suffers torment, the ruthless through all the years stored up for him.
21Terrifying sounds fill his ears; when all seems well, marauders attack him.
22He despairs of escaping the darkness; he is marked for the sword.
23He wanders about-food for vultures ; he knows the day of darkness is at hand.
24Distress and anguish fill him with terror; they overwhelm him, like a king poised to attack,
25because he shakes his fist at God and vaunts himself against the Almighty,
26defiantly charging against him with a thick, strong shield.
27"Though his face is covered with fat and his waist bulges with flesh,
28he will inhabit ruined towns and houses where no one lives, houses crumbling to rubble.
29He will no longer be rich and his wealth will not endure, nor will his possessions spread over the land.
30He will not escape the darkness; a flame will wither his shoots, and the breath of God's mouth will carry him away.
31Let him not deceive himself by trusting what is worthless, for he will get nothing in return.
32Before his time he will be paid in full, and his branches will not flourish.
33He will be like a vine stripped of its unripe grapes, like an olive tree shedding its blossoms.
34For the company of the godless will be barren, and fire will consume the tents of those who love bribes.
35They conceive trouble and give birth to evil; their womb fashions deceit."
16Then Job replied:
2"I have heard many things like these; miserable comforters are you all!
3Will your long-winded speeches never end? What ails you that you keep on arguing?
4I also could speak like you, if you were in my place; I could make fine speeches against you and shake my head at you.
5But my mouth would encourage you; comfort from my lips would bring you relief.
6"Yet if I speak, my pain is not relieved; and if I refrain, it does not go away.
7Surely, O God, you have worn me out; you have devastated my entire household.
8You have bound me-and it has become a witness; my gauntness rises up and testifies against me.
9God assails me and tears me in his anger and gnashes his teeth at me; my opponent fastens on me his piercing eyes.
10Men open their mouths to jeer at me; they strike my cheek in scorn and unite together against me.
11God has turned me over to evil men and thrown me into the clutches of the wicked.
12All was well with me, but he shattered me; he seized me by the neck and crushed me. He has made me his target;
13his archers surround me. Without pity, he pierces my kidneys and spills my gall on the ground.
14Again and again he bursts upon me; he rushes at me like a warrior.
15"I have sewed sackcloth over my skin and buried my brow in the dust.
16My face is red with weeping, deep shadows ring my eyes;
17yet my hands have been free of violence and my prayer is pure.
18"O earth, do not cover my blood; may my cry never be laid to rest!
19Even now my witness is in heaven; my advocate is on high.
20My intercessor is my friend as my eyes pour out tears to God;
21on behalf of a man he pleads with God as a man pleads for his friend.
22"Only a few years will pass before I go on the journey of no return.
17My spirit is broken, my days are cut short, the grave awaits me.
2Surely mockers surround me; my eyes must dwell on their hostility.
3"Give me, O God, the pledge you demand. Who else will put up security for me?
4You have closed their minds to understanding; therefore you will not let them triumph.
5If a man denounces his friends for reward, the eyes of his children will fail.
6"God has made me a byword to everyone, a man in whose face people spit.
7My eyes have grown dim with grief; my whole frame is but a shadow.
8Upright men are appalled at this; the innocent are aroused against the ungodly.
9Nevertheless, the righteous will hold to their ways, and those with clean hands will grow stronger.
10"But come on, all of you, try again! I will not find a wise man among you.
11My days have passed, my plans are shattered, and so are the desires of my heart.
12These men turn night into day; in the face of darkness they say, 'Light is near.'
13If the only home I hope for is the grave, if I spread out my bed in darkness,
14if I say to corruption, 'You are my father,' and to the worm, 'My mother' or 'My sister,'
15where then is my hope? Who can see any hope for me?
16Will it go down to the gates of death ? Will we descend together into the dust?"
18Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:
2"When will you end these speeches? Be sensible, and then we can talk.
3Why are we regarded as cattle and considered stupid in your sight?
4You who tear yourself to pieces in your anger, is the earth to be abandoned for your sake? Or must the rocks be moved from their place?
5"The lamp of the wicked is snuffed out; the flame of his fire stops burning.
6The light in his tent becomes dark; the lamp beside him goes out.
7The vigor of his step is weakened; his own schemes throw him down.
8His feet thrust him into a net and he wanders into its mesh.
9A trap seizes him by the heel; a snare holds him fast.
10A noose is hidden for him on the ground; a trap lies in his path.
11Terrors startle him on every side and dog his every step.
12Calamity is hungry for him; disaster is ready for him when he falls.
13It eats away parts of his skin; death's firstborn devours his limbs.
14He is torn from the security of his tent and marched off to the king of terrors.
15Fire resides in his tent; burning sulfur is scattered over his dwelling.
16His roots dry up below and his branches wither above.
17The memory of him perishes from the earth; he has no name in the land.
18He is driven from light into darkness and is banished from the world.
19He has no offspring or descendants among his people, no survivor where once he lived.
20Men of the west are appalled at his fate; men of the east are seized with horror.
21Surely such is the dwelling of an evil man; such is the place of one who knows not God."
19Then Job replied:
2"How long will you torment me and crush me with words?
3Ten times now you have reproached me; shamelessly you attack me.
4If it is true that I have gone astray, my error remains my concern alone.
5If indeed you would exalt yourselves above me and use my humiliation against me,
6then know that God has wronged me and drawn his net around me.
7"Though I cry, 'I've been wronged!' I get no response; though I call for help, there is no justice.
8He has blocked my way so I cannot pass; he has shrouded my paths in darkness.
9He has stripped me of my honor and removed the crown from my head.
10He tears me down on every side till I am gone; he uproots my hope like a tree.
11His anger burns against me; he counts me among his enemies.
12His troops advance in force; they build a siege ramp against me and encamp around my tent.
13"He has alienated my brothers from me; my acquaintances are completely estranged from me.
14My kinsmen have gone away; my friends have forgotten me.
15My guests and my maidservants count me a stranger; they look upon me as an alien.
16I summon my servant, but he does not answer, though I beg him with my own mouth.
17My breath is offensive to my wife; I am loathsome to my own brothers.
18Even the little boys scorn me; when I appear, they ridicule me.
19All my intimate friends detest me; those I love have turned against me.
20I am nothing but skin and bones; I have escaped with only the skin of my teeth.
21"Have pity on me, my friends, have pity, for the hand of God has struck me.
22Why do you pursue me as God does? Will you never get enough of my flesh?
23"Oh, that my words were recorded, that they were written on a scroll,
24that they were inscribed with an iron tool on lead, or engraved in rock forever!
25I know that my Redeemer lives, and that in the end he will stand upon the earth.
26And after my skin has been destroyed, yet in my flesh I will see God;
27I myself will see him with my own eyes-I, and not another. How my heart yearns within me!
28"If you say, 'How we will hound him, since the root of the trouble lies in him, '
29you should fear the sword yourselves; for wrath will bring punishment by the sword, and then you will know that there is judgment. "
20Then Zophar the Naamathite replied:
2"My troubled thoughts prompt me to answer because I am greatly disturbed.
3I hear a rebuke that dishonors me, and my understanding inspires me to reply.
4"Surely you know how it has been from of old, ever since man was placed on the earth,
5that the mirth of the wicked is brief, the joy of the godless lasts but a moment.
6Though his pride reaches to the heavens and his head touches the clouds,
7he will perish forever, like his own dung; those who have seen him will say, 'Where is he?'
8Like a dream he flies away, no more to be found, banished like a vision of the night.
9The eye that saw him will not see him again; his place will look on him no more.
10His children must make amends to the poor; his own hands must give back his wealth.
11The youthful vigor that fills his bones will lie with him in the dust.
12"Though evil is sweet in his mouth and he hides it under his tongue,
13though he cannot bear to let it go and keeps it in his mouth,
14yet his food will turn sour in his stomach; it will become the venom of serpents within him.
15He will spit out the riches he swallowed; God will make his stomach vomit them up.
16He will suck the poison of serpents; the fangs of an adder will kill him.
17He will not enjoy the streams, the rivers flowing with honey and cream.
18What he toiled for he must give back uneaten; he will not enjoy the profit from his trading.
19For he has oppressed the poor and left them destitute; he has seized houses he did not build.
20"Surely he will have no respite from his craving; he cannot save himself by his treasure.
21Nothing is left for him to devour; his prosperity will not endure.
22In the midst of his plenty, distress will overtake him; the full force of misery will come upon him.
23When he has filled his belly, God will vent his burning anger against him and rain down his blows upon him.
24Though he flees from an iron weapon, a bronze-tipped arrow pierces him.
25He pulls it out of his back, the gleaming point out of his liver. Terrors will come over him;
26total darkness lies in wait for his treasures. A fire unfanned will consume him and devour what is left in his tent.
27The heavens will expose his guilt; the earth will rise up against him.
28A flood will carry off his house, rushing waters on the day of God's wrath.
29Such is the fate God allots the wicked, the heritage appointed for them by God."
21Then Job replied:
2"Listen carefully to my words; let this be the consolation you give me.
3Bear with me while I speak, and after I have spoken, mock on.
4"Is my complaint directed to man? Why should I not be impatient?
5Look at me and be astonished; clap your hand over your mouth.
6When I think about this, I am terrified; trembling seizes my body.
7Why do the wicked live on, growing old and increasing in power?
8They see their children established around them, their offspring before their eyes.
9Their homes are safe and free from fear; the rod of God is not upon them.
10Their bulls never fail to breed; their cows calve and do not miscarry.
11They send forth their children as a flock; their little ones dance about.
12They sing to the music of tambourine and harp; they make merry to the sound of the flute.
13They spend their years in prosperity and go down to the grave in peace.
14Yet they say to God, 'Leave us alone! We have no desire to know your ways.
15Who is the Almighty, that we should serve him? What would we gain by praying to him?'
16But their prosperity is not in their own hands, so I stand aloof from the counsel of the wicked.
17"Yet how often is the lamp of the wicked snuffed out? How often does calamity come upon them, the fate God allots in his anger?
18How often are they like straw before the wind, like chaff swept away by a gale?
19It is said, 'God stores up a man's punishment for his sons.' Let him repay the man himself, so that he will know it!
20Let his own eyes see his destruction; let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty.
21For what does he care about the family he leaves behind when his allotted months come to an end?
22"Can anyone teach knowledge to God, since he judges even the highest?
23One man dies in full vigor, completely secure and at ease,
24his body well nourished, his bones rich with marrow.
25Another man dies in bitterness of soul, never having enjoyed anything good.
26Side by side they lie in the dust, and worms cover them both.
27"I know full well what you are thinking, the schemes by which you would wrong me.
28You say, 'Where now is the great man's house, the tents where wicked men lived?'
29Have you never questioned those who travel? Have you paid no regard to their accounts-
30that the evil man is spared from the day of calamity, that he is delivered from the day of wrath?
31Who denounces his conduct to his face? Who repays him for what he has done?
32He is carried to the grave, and watch is kept over his tomb.
33The soil in the valley is sweet to him; all men follow after him, and a countless throng goes before him.
34"So how can you console me with your nonsense? Nothing is left of your answers but falsehood!"
22Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:
2"Can a man be of benefit to God? Can even a wise man benefit him?
3What pleasure would it give the Almighty if you were righteous? What would he gain if your ways were blameless?
4"Is it for your piety that he rebukes you and brings charges against you?
5Is not your wickedness great? Are not your sins endless?
6You demanded security from your brothers for no reason; you stripped men of their clothing, leaving them naked.
7You gave no water to the weary and you withheld food from the hungry,
8though you were a powerful man, owning land- an honored man, living on it.
9And you sent widows away empty-handed and broke the strength of the fatherless.
10That is why snares are all around you, why sudden peril terrifies you,
11why it is so dark you cannot see, and why a flood of water covers you.
12"Is not God in the heights of heaven? And see how lofty are the highest stars!
13Yet you say, 'What does God know? Does he judge through such darkness?
14Thick clouds veil him, so he does not see us as he goes about in the vaulted heavens.'
15Will you keep to the old path that evil men have trod?
16They were carried off before their time, their foundations washed away by a flood.
17They said to God, 'Leave us alone! What can the Almighty do to us?'
18Yet it was he who filled their houses with good things, so I stand aloof from the counsel of the wicked.
19"The righteous see their ruin and rejoice; the innocent mock them, saying,
20'Surely our foes are destroyed, and fire devours their wealth.'
21"Submit to God and be at peace with him; in this way prosperity will come to you.
22Accept instruction from his mouth and lay up his words in your heart.
23If you return to the Almighty, you will be restored: If you remove wickedness far from your tent
24and assign your nuggets to the dust, your gold of Ophir to the rocks in the ravines,
25then the Almighty will be your gold, the choicest silver for you.
26Surely then you will find delight in the Almighty and will lift up your face to God.
27You will pray to him, and he will hear you, and you will fulfill your vows.
28What you decide on will be done, and light will shine on your ways.
29When men are brought low and you say, 'Lift them up!' then he will save the downcast.
30He will deliver even one who is not innocent, who will be delivered through the cleanness of your hands."
23Then Job replied:
2"Even today my complaint is bitter; his hand is heavy in spite of my groaning.
3If only I knew where to find him; if only I could go to his dwelling!
4I would state my case before him and fill my mouth with arguments.
5I would find out what he would answer me, and consider what he would say.
6Would he oppose me with great power? No, he would not press charges against me.
7There an upright man could present his case before him, and I would be delivered forever from my judge.
8"But if I go to the east, he is not there; if I go to the west, I do not find him.
9When he is at work in the north, I do not see him; when he turns to the south, I catch no glimpse of him.
10But he knows the way that I take; when he has tested me, I will come forth as gold.
11My feet have closely followed his steps; I have kept to his way without turning aside.
12I have not departed from the commands of his lips; I have treasured the words of his mouth more than my daily bread.
13"But he stands alone, and who can oppose him? He does whatever he pleases.
14He carries out his decree against me, and many such plans he still has in store.
15That is why I am terrified before him; when I think of all this, I fear him.
16God has made my heart faint; the Almighty has terrified me.
17Yet I am not silenced by the darkness, by the thick darkness that covers my face.
24"Why does the Almighty not set times for judgment? Why must those who know him look in vain for such days?
2Men move boundary stones; they pasture flocks they have stolen.
3They drive away the orphan's donkey and take the widow's ox in pledge.
4They thrust the needy from the path and force all the poor of the land into hiding.
5Like wild donkeys in the desert, the poor go about their labor of foraging food; the wasteland provides food for their children.
6They gather fodder in the fields and glean in the vineyards of the wicked.
7Lacking clothes, they spend the night naked; they have nothing to cover themselves in the cold.
8They are drenched by mountain rains and hug the rocks for lack of shelter.
9The fatherless child is snatched from the breast; the infant of the poor is seized for a debt.
10Lacking clothes, they go about naked; they carry the sheaves, but still go hungry.
11They crush olives among the terraces ; they tread the winepresses, yet suffer thirst.
12The groans of the dying rise from the city, and the souls of the wounded cry out for help. But God charges no one with wrongdoing.
13"There are those who rebel against the light, who do not know its ways or stay in its paths.
14When daylight is gone, the murderer rises up and kills the poor and needy; in the night he steals forth like a thief.
15The eye of the adulterer watches for dusk; he thinks, 'No eye will see me,' and he keeps his face concealed.
16In the dark, men break into houses, but by day they shut themselves in; they want nothing to do with the light.
17For all of them, deep darkness is their morning ; they make friends with the terrors of darkness.
18"Yet they are foam on the surface of the water; their portion of the land is cursed, so that no one goes to the vineyards.
19As heat and drought snatch away the melted snow, so the grave snatches away those who have sinned.
20The womb forgets them, the worm feasts on them; evil men are no longer remembered but are broken like a tree.
21They prey on the barren and childless woman, and to the widow show no kindness.
22But God drags away the mighty by his power; though they become established, they have no assurance of life.
23He may let them rest in a feeling of security, but his eyes are on their ways.
24For a little while they are exalted, and then they are gone; they are brought low and gathered up like all others; they are cut off like heads of grain.
25"If this is not so, who can prove me false and reduce my words to nothing?"
25Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:
2"Dominion and awe belong to God; he establishes order in the heights of heaven.
3Can his forces be numbered? Upon whom does his light not rise?
4How then can a man be righteous before God? How can one born of woman be pure?
5If even the moon is not bright and the stars are not pure in his eyes,
6how much less man, who is but a maggot- a son of man, who is only a worm!"
26Then Job replied:
2"How you have helped the powerless! How you have saved the arm that is feeble!
3What advice you have offered to one without wisdom! And what great insight you have displayed!
4Who has helped you utter these words? And whose spirit spoke from your mouth?
5"The dead are in deep anguish, those beneath the waters and all that live in them.
6Death is naked before God; Destruction lies uncovered.
7He spreads out the northern skies over empty space; he suspends the earth over nothing.
8He wraps up the waters in his clouds, yet the clouds do not burst under their weight.
9He covers the face of the full moon, spreading his clouds over it.
10He marks out the horizon on the face of the waters for a boundary between light and darkness.
11The pillars of the heavens quake, aghast at his rebuke.
12By his power he churned up the sea; by his wisdom he cut Rahab to pieces.
13By his breath the skies became fair; his hand pierced the gliding serpent.
14And these are but the outer fringe of his works; how faint the whisper we hear of him! Who then can understand the thunder of his power?"
27And Job continued his discourse:
2"As surely as God lives, who has denied me justice, the Almighty, who has made me taste bitterness of soul,
3as long as I have life within me, the breath of God in my nostrils,
4my lips will not speak wickedness, and my tongue will utter no deceit.
5I will never admit you are in the right; till I die, I will not deny my integrity.
6I will maintain my righteousness and never let go of it; my conscience will not reproach me as long as I live.
7"May my enemies be like the wicked, my adversaries like the unjust!
8For what hope has the godless when he is cut off, when God takes away his life?
9Does God listen to his cry when distress comes upon him?
10Will he find delight in the Almighty? Will he call upon God at all times?
11"I will teach you about the power of God; the ways of the Almighty I will not conceal.
12You have all seen this yourselves. Why then this meaningless talk?
13"Here is the fate God allots to the wicked, the heritage a ruthless man receives from the Almighty:
14However many his children, their fate is the sword; his offspring will never have enough to eat.
15The plague will bury those who survive him, and their widows will not weep for them.
16Though he heaps up silver like dust and clothes like piles of clay,
17what he lays up the righteous will wear, and the innocent will divide his silver.
18The house he builds is like a moth's cocoon, like a hut made by a watchman.
19He lies down wealthy, but will do so no more; when he opens his eyes, all is gone.
20Terrors overtake him like a flood; a tempest snatches him away in the night.
21The east wind carries him off, and he is gone; it sweeps him out of his place.
22It hurls itself against him without mercy as he flees headlong from its power.
23It claps its hands in derision and hisses him out of his place.
28"There is a mine for silver and a place where gold is refined.
2Iron is taken from the earth, and copper is smelted from ore.
3Man puts an end to the darkness; he searches the farthest recesses for ore in the blackest darkness.
4Far from where people dwell he cuts a shaft, in places forgotten by the foot of man; far from men he dangles and sways.
5The earth, from which food comes, is transformed below as by fire;
6sapphires come from its rocks, and its dust contains nuggets of gold.
7No bird of prey knows that hidden path, no falcon's eye has seen it.
8Proud beasts do not set foot on it, and no lion prowls there.
9Man's hand assaults the flinty rock and lays bare the roots of the mountains.
10He tunnels through the rock; his eyes see all its treasures.
11He searches the sources of the rivers and brings hidden things to light.
12"But where can wisdom be found? Where does understanding dwell?
13Man does not comprehend its worth; it cannot be found in the land of the living.
14The deep says, 'It is not in me'; the sea says, 'It is not with me.'
15It cannot be bought with the finest gold, nor can its price be weighed in silver.
16It cannot be bought with the gold of Ophir, with precious onyx or sapphires.
17Neither gold nor crystal can compare with it, nor can it be had for jewels of gold.
18Coral and jasper are not worthy of mention; the price of wisdom is beyond rubies.
19The topaz of Cush cannot compare with it; it cannot be bought with pure gold.
20"Where then does wisdom come from? Where does understanding dwell?
21It is hidden from the eyes of every living thing, concealed even from the birds of the air.
22Destruction and Death say, 'Only a rumor of it has reached our ears.'
23God understands the way to it and he alone knows where it dwells,
24for he views the ends of the earth and sees everything under the heavens.
25When he established the force of the wind and measured out the waters,
26when he made a decree for the rain and a path for the thunderstorm,
27then he looked at wisdom and appraised it; he confirmed it and tested it.
28And he said to man, 'The fear of the Lord-that is wisdom, and to shun evil is understanding.' "
29Job continued his discourse:
2"How I long for the months gone by, for the days when God watched over me,
3when his lamp shone upon my head and by his light I walked through darkness!
4Oh, for the days when I was in my prime, when God's intimate friendship blessed my house,
5when the Almighty was still with me and my children were around me,
6when my path was drenched with cream and the rock poured out for me streams of olive oil.
7"When I went to the gate of the city and took my seat in the public square,
8the young men saw me and stepped aside and the old men rose to their feet;
9the chief men refrained from speaking and covered their mouths with their hands;
10the voices of the nobles were hushed, and their tongues stuck to the roof of their mouths.
11Whoever heard me spoke well of me, and those who saw me commended me,
12because I rescued the poor who cried for help, and the fatherless who had none to assist him.
13The man who was dying blessed me; I made the widow's heart sing.
14I put on righteousness as my clothing; justice was my robe and my turban.
15I was eyes to the blind and feet to the lame.
16I was a father to the needy; I took up the case of the stranger.
17I broke the fangs of the wicked and snatched the victims from their teeth.
18"I thought, 'I will die in my own house, my days as numerous as the grains of sand.
19My roots will reach to the water, and the dew will lie all night on my branches.
20My glory will remain fresh in me, the bow ever new in my hand.'
21"Men listened to me expectantly, waiting in silence for my counsel.
22After I had spoken, they spoke no more; my words fell gently on their ears.
23They waited for me as for showers and drank in my words as the spring rain.
24When I smiled at them, they scarcely believed it; the light of my face was precious to them.
25I chose the way for them and sat as their chief; I dwelt as a king among his troops; I was like one who comforts mourners.
30"But now they mock me, men younger than I, whose fathers I would have disdained to put with my sheep dogs.
2Of what use was the strength of their hands to me, since their vigor had gone from them?
3Haggard from want and hunger, they roamed the parched land in desolate wastelands at night.
4In the brush they gathered salt herbs, and their food was the root of the broom tree.
5They were banished from their fellow men, shouted at as if they were thieves.
6They were forced to live in the dry stream beds, among the rocks and in holes in the ground.
7They brayed among the bushes and huddled in the undergrowth.
8A base and nameless brood, they were driven out of the land.
9"And now their sons mock me in song; I have become a byword among them.
10They detest me and keep their distance; they do not hesitate to spit in my face.
11Now that God has unstrung my bow and afflicted me, they throw off restraint in my presence.
12On my right the tribe attacks; they lay snares for my feet, they build their siege ramps against me.
13They break up my road; they succeed in destroying me- without anyone's helping them.
14They advance as through a gaping breach; amid the ruins they come rolling in.
15Terrors overwhelm me; my dignity is driven away as by the wind, my safety vanishes like a cloud.
16"And now my life ebbs away; days of suffering grip me.
17Night pierces my bones; my gnawing pains never rest.
18In his great power God becomes like clothing to me ; he binds me like the neck of my garment.
19He throws me into the mud, and I am reduced to dust and ashes.
20"I cry out to you, O God, but you do not answer; I stand up, but you merely look at me.
21You turn on me ruthlessly; with the might of your hand you attack me.
22You snatch me up and drive me before the wind; you toss me about in the storm.
23I know you will bring me down to death, to the place appointed for all the living.
24"Surely no one lays a hand on a broken man when he cries for help in his distress.
25Have I not wept for those in trouble? Has not my soul grieved for the poor?
26Yet when I hoped for good, evil came; when I looked for light, then came darkness.
27The churning inside me never stops; days of suffering confront me.
28I go about blackened, but not by the sun; I stand up in the assembly and cry for help.
29I have become a brother of jackals, a companion of owls.
30My skin grows black and peels; my body burns with fever.
31My harp is tuned to mourning, and my flute to the sound of wailing.
31"I made a covenant with my eyes not to look lustfully at a girl.
2For what is man's lot from God above, his heritage from the Almighty on high?
3Is it not ruin for the wicked, disaster for those who do wrong?
4Does he not see my ways and count my every step?
5"If I have walked in falsehood or my foot has hurried after deceit-
6let God weigh me in honest scales and he will know that I am blameless-
7if my steps have turned from the path, if my heart has been led by my eyes, or if my hands have been defiled,
8then may others eat what I have sown, and may my crops be uprooted.
9"If my heart has been enticed by a woman, or if I have lurked at my neighbor's door,
10then may my wife grind another man's grain, and may other men sleep with her.
11For that would have been shameful, a sin to be judged.
12It is a fire that burns to Destruction ; it would have uprooted my harvest.
13"If I have denied justice to my menservants and maidservants when they had a grievance against me,
14what will I do when God confronts me? What will I answer when called to account?
15Did not he who made me in the womb make them? Did not the same one form us both within our mothers?
16"If I have denied the desires of the poor or let the eyes of the widow grow weary,
17if I have kept my bread to myself, not sharing it with the fatherless-
18but from my youth I reared him as would a father, and from my birth I guided the widow-
19if I have seen anyone perishing for lack of clothing, or a needy man without a garment,
20and his heart did not bless me for warming him with the fleece from my sheep,
21if I have raised my hand against the fatherless, knowing that I had influence in court,
22then let my arm fall from the shoulder, let it be broken off at the joint.
23For I dreaded destruction from God, and for fear of his splendor I could not do such things.
24"If I have put my trust in gold or said to pure gold, 'You are my security,'
25if I have rejoiced over my great wealth, the fortune my hands had gained,
26if I have regarded the sun in its radiance or the moon moving in splendor,
27so that my heart was secretly enticed and my hand offered them a kiss of homage,
28then these also would be sins to be judged, for I would have been unfaithful to God on high.
29"If I have rejoiced at my enemy's misfortune or gloated over the trouble that came to him-
30I have not allowed my mouth to sin by invoking a curse against his life-
31if the men of my household have never said, 'Who has not had his fill of Job's meat?'-
32but no stranger had to spend the night in the street, for my door was always open to the traveler-
33if I have concealed my sin as men do, by hiding my guilt in my heart
34because I so feared the crowd and so dreaded the contempt of the clans that I kept silent and would not go outside
35("Oh, that I had someone to hear me! I sign now my defense-let the Almighty answer me; let my accuser put his indictment in writing.
36Surely I would wear it on my shoulder, I would put it on like a crown.
37I would give him an account of my every step; like a prince I would approach him.)-
38"if my land cries out against me and all its furrows are wet with tears,
39if I have devoured its yield without payment or broken the spirit of its tenants,
40then let briers come up instead of wheat and weeds instead of barley." The words of Job are ended.
32So these three men stopped answering Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.
2But Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, became very angry with Job for justifying himself rather than God.
3He was also angry with the three friends, because they had found no way to refute Job, and yet had condemned him.
4Now Elihu had waited before speaking to Job because they were older than he.
5But when he saw that the three men had nothing more to say, his anger was aroused.
6So Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite said: "I am young in years, and you are old; that is why I was fearful, not daring to tell you what I know.
7I thought, 'Age should speak; advanced years should teach wisdom.'
8But it is the spirit in a man, the breath of the Almighty, that gives him understanding.
9It is not only the old who are wise, not only the aged who understand what is right.
10"Therefore I say: Listen to me; I too will tell you what I know.
11I waited while you spoke, I listened to your reasoning; while you were searching for words,
12I gave you my full attention. But not one of you has proved Job wrong; none of you has answered his arguments.
13Do not say, 'We have found wisdom; let God refute him, not man.'
14But Job has not marshaled his words against me, and I will not answer him with your arguments.
15"They are dismayed and have no more to say; words have failed them.
16Must I wait, now that they are silent, now that they stand there with no reply?
17I too will have my say; I too will tell what I know.
18For I am full of words, and the spirit within me compels me;
19inside I am like bottled-up wine, like new wineskins ready to burst.
20I must speak and find relief; I must open my lips and reply.
21I will show partiality to no one, nor will I flatter any man;
22for if I were skilled in flattery, my Maker would soon take me away.
33"But now, Job, listen to my words; pay attention to everything I say.
2I am about to open my mouth; my words are on the tip of my tongue.
3My words come from an upright heart; my lips sincerely speak what I know.
4The Spirit of God has made me; the breath of the Almighty gives me life.
5Answer me then, if you can; prepare yourself and confront me.
6I am just like you before God; I too have been taken from clay.
7No fear of me should alarm you, nor should my hand be heavy upon you.
8"But you have said in my hearing- I heard the very words-
9'I am pure and without sin; I am clean and free from guilt.
10Yet God has found fault with me; he considers me his enemy.
11He fastens my feet in shackles; he keeps close watch on all my paths.'
12"But I tell you, in this you are not right, for God is greater than man.
13Why do you complain to him that he answers none of man's words ?
14For God does speak-now one way, now another- though man may not perceive it.
15In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls on men as they slumber in their beds,
16he may speak in their ears and terrify them with warnings,
17to turn man from wrongdoing and keep him from pride,
18to preserve his soul from the pit, his life from perishing by the sword.
19Or a man may be chastened on a bed of pain with constant distress in his bones,
20so that his very being finds food repulsive and his soul loathes the choicest meal.
21His flesh wastes away to nothing, and his bones, once hidden, now stick out.
22His soul draws near to the pit, and his life to the messengers of death.
23"Yet if there is an angel on his side as a mediator, one out of a thousand, to tell a man what is right for him,
24to be gracious to him and say, 'Spare him from going down to the pit ; I have found a ransom for him'-
25then his flesh is renewed like a child's; it is restored as in the days of his youth.
26He prays to God and finds favor with him, he sees God's face and shouts for joy; he is restored by God to his righteous state.
27Then he comes to men and says, 'I sinned, and perverted what was right, but I did not get what I deserved.
28He redeemed my soul from going down to the pit, and I will live to enjoy the light.'
29"God does all these things to a man- twice, even three times-
30to turn back his soul from the pit, that the light of life may shine on him.
31"Pay attention, Job, and listen to me; be silent, and I will speak.
32If you have anything to say, answer me; speak up, for I want you to be cleared.
33But if not, then listen to me; be silent, and I will teach you wisdom."
34Then Elihu said:
2"Hear my words, you wise men; listen to me, you men of learning.
3For the ear tests words as the tongue tastes food.
4Let us discern for ourselves what is right; let us learn together what is good.
5"Job says, 'I am innocent, but God denies me justice.
6Although I am right, I am considered a liar; although I am guiltless, his arrow inflicts an incurable wound.'
7What man is like Job, who drinks scorn like water?
8He keeps company with evildoers; he associates with wicked men.
9For he says, 'It profits a man nothing when he tries to please God.'
10"So listen to me, you men of understanding. Far be it from God to do evil, from the Almighty to do wrong.
11He repays a man for what he has done; he brings upon him what his conduct deserves.
12It is unthinkable that God would do wrong, that the Almighty would pervert justice.
13Who appointed him over the earth? Who put him in charge of the whole world?
14If it were his intention and he withdrew his spirit and breath,
15all mankind would perish together and man would return to the dust.
16"If you have understanding, hear this; listen to what I say.
17Can he who hates justice govern? Will you condemn the just and mighty One?
18Is he not the One who says to kings, 'You are worthless,' and to nobles, 'You are wicked,'
19who shows no partiality to princes and does not favor the rich over the poor, for they are all the work of his hands?
20They die in an instant, in the middle of the night; the people are shaken and they pass away; the mighty are removed without human hand.
21"His eyes are on the ways of men; he sees their every step.
22There is no dark place, no deep shadow, where evildoers can hide.
23God has no need to examine men further, that they should come before him for judgment.
24Without inquiry he shatters the mighty and sets up others in their place.
25Because he takes note of their deeds, he overthrows them in the night and they are crushed.
26He punishes them for their wickedness where everyone can see them,
27because they turned from following him and had no regard for any of his ways.
28They caused the cry of the poor to come before him, so that he heard the cry of the needy.
29But if he remains silent, who can condemn him? If he hides his face, who can see him? Yet he is over man and nation alike,
30to keep a godless man from ruling, from laying snares for the people.
31"Suppose a man says to God, 'I am guilty but will offend no more.
32Teach me what I cannot see; if I have done wrong, I will not do so again.'
33Should God then reward you on your terms, when you refuse to repent? You must decide, not I; so tell me what you know.
34"Men of understanding declare, wise men who hear me say to me,
35'Job speaks without knowledge; his words lack insight.'
36Oh, that Job might be tested to the utmost for answering like a wicked man!
37To his sin he adds rebellion; scornfully he claps his hands among us and multiplies his words against God."
35Then Elihu said:
2"Do you think this is just? You say, 'I will be cleared by God. '
3Yet you ask him, 'What profit is it to me, and what do I gain by not sinning?'
4"I would like to reply to you and to your friends with you.
5Look up at the heavens and see; gaze at the clouds so high above you.
6If you sin, how does that affect him? If your sins are many, what does that do to him?
7If you are righteous, what do you give to him, or what does he receive from your hand?
8Your wickedness affects only a man like yourself, and your righteousness only the sons of men.
9"Men cry out under a load of oppression; they plead for relief from the arm of the powerful.
10But no one says, 'Where is God my Maker, who gives songs in the night,
11who teaches more to us than to the beasts of the earth and makes us wiser than the birds of the air?'
12He does not answer when men cry out because of the arrogance of the wicked.
13Indeed, God does not listen to their empty plea; the Almighty pays no attention to it.
14How much less, then, will he listen when you say that you do not see him, that your case is before him and you must wait for him,
15and further, that his anger never punishes and he does not take the least notice of wickedness.
16So Job opens his mouth with empty talk; without knowledge he multiplies words."
36Elihu continued:
2"Bear with me a little longer and I will show you that there is more to be said in God's behalf.
3I get my knowledge from afar; I will ascribe justice to my Maker.
4Be assured that my words are not false; one perfect in knowledge is with you.
5"God is mighty, but does not despise men; he is mighty, and firm in his purpose.
6He does not keep the wicked alive but gives the afflicted their rights.
7He does not take his eyes off the righteous; he enthrones them with kings and exalts them forever.
8But if men are bound in chains, held fast by cords of affliction,
9he tells them what they have done- that they have sinned arrogantly.
10He makes them listen to correction and commands them to repent of their evil.
11If they obey and serve him, they will spend the rest of their days in prosperity and their years in contentment.
12But if they do not listen, they will perish by the sword and die without knowledge.
13"The godless in heart harbor resentment; even when he fetters them, they do not cry for help.
14They die in their youth, among male prostitutes of the shrines.
15But those who suffer he delivers in their suffering; he speaks to them in their affliction.
16"He is wooing you from the jaws of distress to a spacious place free from restriction, to the comfort of your table laden with choice food.
17But now you are laden with the judgment due the wicked; judgment and justice have taken hold of you.
18Be careful that no one entices you by riches; do not let a large bribe turn you aside.
19Would your wealth or even all your mighty efforts sustain you so you would not be in distress?
20Do not long for the night, to drag people away from their homes.
21Beware of turning to evil, which you seem to prefer to affliction.
22"God is exalted in his power. Who is a teacher like him?
23Who has prescribed his ways for him, or said to him, 'You have done wrong'?
24Remember to extol his work, which men have praised in song.
25All mankind has seen it; men gaze on it from afar.
26How great is God-beyond our understanding! The number of his years is past finding out.
27"He draws up the drops of water, which distill as rain to the streams ;
28the clouds pour down their moisture and abundant showers fall on mankind.
29Who can understand how he spreads out the clouds, how he thunders from his pavilion?
30See how he scatters his lightning about him, bathing the depths of the sea.
31This is the way he governs the nations and provides food in abundance.
32He fills his hands with lightning and commands it to strike its mark.
33His thunder announces the coming storm; even the cattle make known its approach.
37"At this my heart pounds and leaps from its place.
2Listen! Listen to the roar of his voice, to the rumbling that comes from his mouth.
3He unleashes his lightning beneath the whole heaven and sends it to the ends of the earth.
4After that comes the sound of his roar; he thunders with his majestic voice. When his voice resounds, he holds nothing back.
5God's voice thunders in marvelous ways; he does great things beyond our understanding.
6He says to the snow, 'Fall on the earth,' and to the rain shower, 'Be a mighty downpour.'
7So that all men he has made may know his work, he stops every man from his labor.
8The animals take cover; they remain in their dens.
9The tempest comes out from its chamber, the cold from the driving winds.
10The breath of God produces ice, and the broad waters become frozen.
11He loads the clouds with moisture; he scatters his lightning through them.
12At his direction they swirl around over the face of the whole earth to do whatever he commands them.
13He brings the clouds to punish men, or to water his earth and show his love.
14"Listen to this, Job; stop and consider God's wonders.
15Do you know how God controls the clouds and makes his lightning flash?
16Do you know how the clouds hang poised, those wonders of him who is perfect in knowledge?
17You who swelter in your clothes when the land lies hushed under the south wind,
18can you join him in spreading out the skies, hard as a mirror of cast bronze?
19"Tell us what we should say to him; we cannot draw up our case because of our darkness.
20Should he be told that I want to speak? Would any man ask to be swallowed up?
21Now no one can look at the sun, bright as it is in the skies after the wind has swept them clean.
22Out of the north he comes in golden splendor; God comes in awesome majesty.
23The Almighty is beyond our reach and exalted in power; in his justice and great righteousness, he does not oppress.
24Therefore, men revere him, for does he not have regard for all the wise in heart? "
38Then the Lord answered Job out of the storm. He said:
2"Who is this that darkens my counsel with words without knowledge?
3Brace yourself like a man; I will question you, and you shall answer me.
4"Where were you when I laid the earth's foundation? Tell me, if you understand.
5Who marked off its dimensions? Surely you know! Who stretched a measuring line across it?
6On what were its footings set, or who laid its cornerstone-
7while the morning stars sang together and all the angels shouted for joy?
8"Who shut up the sea behind doors when it burst forth from the womb,
9when I made the clouds its garment and wrapped it in thick darkness,
10when I fixed limits for it and set its doors and bars in place,
11when I said, 'This far you may come and no farther; here is where your proud waves halt'?
12"Have you ever given orders to the morning, or shown the dawn its place,
13that it might take the earth by the edges and shake the wicked out of it?
14The earth takes shape like clay under a seal; its features stand out like those of a garment.
15The wicked are denied their light, and their upraised arm is broken.
16"Have you journeyed to the springs of the sea or walked in the recesses of the deep?
17Have the gates of death been shown to you? Have you seen the gates of the shadow of death ?
18Have you comprehended the vast expanses of the earth? Tell me, if you know all this.
19"What is the way to the abode of light? And where does darkness reside?
20Can you take them to their places? Do you know the paths to their dwellings?
21Surely you know, for you were already born! You have lived so many years!
22"Have you entered the storehouses of the snow or seen the storehouses of the hail,
23which I reserve for times of trouble, for days of war and battle?
24What is the way to the place where the lightning is dispersed, or the place where the east winds are scattered over the earth?
25Who cuts a channel for the torrents of rain, and a path for the thunderstorm,
26to water a land where no man lives, a desert with no one in it,
27to satisfy a desolate wasteland and make it sprout with grass?
28Does the rain have a father? Who fathers the drops of dew?
29From whose womb comes the ice? Who gives birth to the frost from the heavens
30when the waters become hard as stone, when the surface of the deep is frozen?
31"Can you bind the beautiful Pleiades? Can you loose the cords of Orion?
32Can you bring forth the constellations in their seasons or lead out the Bear with its cubs?
33Do you know the laws of the heavens? Can you set up God's dominion over the earth?
34"Can you raise your voice to the clouds and cover yourself with a flood of water?
35Do you send the lightning bolts on their way? Do they report to you, 'Here we are'?
36Who endowed the heart with wisdom or gave understanding to the mind ?
37Who has the wisdom to count the clouds? Who can tip over the water jars of the heavens
38when the dust becomes hard and the clods of earth stick together?
39"Do you hunt the prey for the lioness and satisfy the hunger of the lions
40when they crouch in their dens or lie in wait in a thicket?
41Who provides food for the raven when its young cry out to God and wander about for lack of food?
39"Do you know when the mountain goats give birth? Do you watch when the doe bears her fawn?
2Do you count the months till they bear? Do you know the time they give birth?
3They crouch down and bring forth their young; their labor pains are ended.
4Their young thrive and grow strong in the wilds; they leave and do not return.
5"Who let the wild donkey go free? Who untied his ropes?
6I gave him the wasteland as his home, the salt flats as his habitat.
7He laughs at the commotion in the town; he does not hear a driver's shout.
8He ranges the hills for his pasture and searches for any green thing.
9"Will the wild ox consent to serve you? Will he stay by your manger at night?
10Can you hold him to the furrow with a harness? Will he till the valleys behind you?
11Will you rely on him for his great strength? Will you leave your heavy work to him?
12Can you trust him to bring in your grain and gather it to your threshing floor?
13"The wings of the ostrich flap joyfully, but they cannot compare with the pinions and feathers of the stork.
14She lays her eggs on the ground and lets them warm in the sand,
15unmindful that a foot may crush them, that some wild animal may trample them.
16She treats her young harshly, as if they were not hers; she cares not that her labor was in vain,
17for God did not endow her with wisdom or give her a share of good sense.
18Yet when she spreads her feathers to run, she laughs at horse and rider.
19"Do you give the horse his strength or clothe his neck with a flowing mane?
20Do you make him leap like a locust, striking terror with his proud snorting?
21He paws fiercely, rejoicing in his strength, and charges into the fray.
22He laughs at fear, afraid of nothing; he does not shy away from the sword.
23The quiver rattles against his side, along with the flashing spear and lance.
24In frenzied excitement he eats up the ground; he cannot stand still when the trumpet sounds.
25At the blast of the trumpet he snorts, 'Aha!' He catches the scent of battle from afar, the shout of commanders and the battle cry.
26"Does the hawk take flight by your wisdom and spread his wings toward the south?
27Does the eagle soar at your command and build his nest on high?
28He dwells on a cliff and stays there at night; a rocky crag is his stronghold.
29From there he seeks out his food; his eyes detect it from afar.
30His young ones feast on blood, and where the slain are, there is he."
40The Lord said to Job:
2"Will the one who contends with the Almighty correct him? Let him who accuses God answer him!"
3Then Job answered the Lord :
4"I am unworthy-how can I reply to you? I put my hand over my mouth.
5I spoke once, but I have no answer- twice, but I will say no more."
6Then the Lord spoke to Job out of the storm:
7"Brace yourself like a man; I will question you, and you shall answer me.
8"Would you discredit my justice? Would you condemn me to justify yourself?
9Do you have an arm like God's, and can your voice thunder like his?
10Then adorn yourself with glory and splendor, and clothe yourself in honor and majesty.
11Unleash the fury of your wrath, look at every proud man and bring him low,
12look at every proud man and humble him, crush the wicked where they stand.
13Bury them all in the dust together; shroud their faces in the grave.
14Then I myself will admit to you that your own right hand can save you.
15"Look at the behemoth, which I made along with you and which feeds on grass like an ox.
16What strength he has in his loins, what power in the muscles of his belly!
17His tail sways like a cedar; the sinews of his thighs are close-knit.
18His bones are tubes of bronze, his limbs like rods of iron.
19He ranks first among the works of God, yet his Maker can approach him with his sword.
20The hills bring him their produce, and all the wild animals play nearby.
21Under the lotus plants he lies, hidden among the reeds in the marsh.
22The lotuses conceal him in their shadow; the poplars by the stream surround him.
23When the river rages, he is not alarmed; he is secure, though the Jordan should surge against his mouth.
24Can anyone capture him by the eyes, or trap him and pierce his nose?
41"Can you pull in the leviathan with a fishhook or tie down his tongue with a rope?
2Can you put a cord through his nose or pierce his jaw with a hook?
3Will he keep begging you for mercy? Will he speak to you with gentle words?
4Will he make an agreement with you for you to take him as your slave for life?
5Can you make a pet of him like a bird or put him on a leash for your girls?
6Will traders barter for him? Will they divide him up among the merchants?
7Can you fill his hide with harpoons or his head with fishing spears?
8If you lay a hand on him, you will remember the struggle and never do it again!
9Any hope of subduing him is false; the mere sight of him is overpowering.
10No one is fierce enough to rouse him. Who then is able to stand against me?
11Who has a claim against me that I must pay? Everything under heaven belongs to me.
12"I will not fail to speak of his limbs, his strength and his graceful form.
13Who can strip off his outer coat? Who would approach him with a bridle?
14Who dares open the doors of his mouth, ringed about with his fearsome teeth?
15His back has rows of shields tightly sealed together;
16each is so close to the next that no air can pass between.
17They are joined fast to one another; they cling together and cannot be parted.
18His snorting throws out flashes of light; his eyes are like the rays of dawn.
19Firebrands stream from his mouth; sparks of fire shoot out.
20Smoke pours from his nostrils as from a boiling pot over a fire of reeds.
21His breath sets coals ablaze, and flames dart from his mouth.
22Strength resides in his neck; dismay goes before him.
23The folds of his flesh are tightly joined; they are firm and immovable.
24His chest is hard as rock, hard as a lower millstone.
25When he rises up, the mighty are terrified; they retreat before his thrashing.
26The sword that reaches him has no effect, nor does the spear or the dart or the javelin.
27Iron he treats like straw and bronze like rotten wood.
28Arrows do not make him flee; slingstones are like chaff to him.
29A club seems to him but a piece of straw; he laughs at the rattling of the lance.
30His undersides are jagged potsherds, leaving a trail in the mud like a threshing sledge.
31He makes the depths churn like a boiling caldron and stirs up the sea like a pot of ointment.
32Behind him he leaves a glistening wake; one would think the deep had white hair.
33Nothing on earth is his equal- a creature without fear.
34He looks down on all that are haughty; he is king over all that are proud."
42Then Job replied to the Lord :
2"I know that you can do all things; no plan of yours can be thwarted.
3You asked, 'Who is this that obscures my counsel without knowledge?' Surely I spoke of things I did not understand, things too wonderful for me to know.
4"You said, 'Listen now, and I will speak; I will question you, and you shall answer me.'
5My ears had heard of you but now my eyes have seen you.
6Therefore I despise myself and repent in dust and ashes."
7After the Lord had said these things to Job, he said to Eliphaz the Temanite, "I am angry with you and your two friends, because you have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has.
8So now take seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant Job and sacrifice a burnt offering for yourselves. My servant Job will pray for you, and I will accept his prayer and not deal with you according to your folly. You have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has."
9So Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite did what the Lord told them; and the Lord accepted Job's prayer.
10After Job had prayed for his friends, the Lord made him prosperous again and gave him twice as much as he had before.
11All his brothers and sisters and everyone who had known him before came and ate with him in his house. They comforted and consoled him over all the trouble the Lord had brought upon him, and each one gave him a piece of silver and a gold ring.
12The Lord blessed the latter part of Job's life more than the first. He had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, a thousand yoke of oxen and a thousand donkeys.
13And he also had seven sons and three daughters.
14The first daughter he named Jemimah, the second Keziah and the third Keren-Happuch.
15Nowhere in all the land were there found women as beautiful as Job's daughters, and their father granted them an inheritance along with their brothers.
16After this, Job lived a hundred and forty years; he saw his children and their children to the fourth generation.
17And so he died, old and full of years.
